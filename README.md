# Game data Analysis:

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution built to extract actionable insights from professional basketball (NBA) game data. It focuses on understanding key factors that influence game outcomes, with a particular emphasis on home team performance. This project is ideal for data analysts seeking hands-on experience with:

- Data cleaning and transformation in Python
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and correlation studies
- Predictive modeling using machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Advanced statistical insights for business or sports decision-making

### Objectives
- Determine which teams have the highest win rates at home
- Analyze the impact of field goal %, 3-point %, assists, and rebounds on winning
- Explore seasonal and weekday performance trends
- Identify teams that excel under pressure (e.g., low free-throw percentage)
- Evaluate the correlation of key stats with game outcomes
- Build classification models to predict home team wins
- Highlight overperforming teams despite low shooting performance

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Jupyter Notebook (run through browser), Python (for all code and analysis)
   - **Goal**: The goal of this project is to create a well-organized and scalable workspace for analyzing NBA game data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project structure separates raw data, analysis notebooks, and visual outputs, allowing for clear and efficient workflows. The objective is to explore team performance metrics, identify key factors influencing game outcomes, and gain insights into patterns such as home-court advantage, shooting efficiency, and team strategies — all to support data-driven sports analysis.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

### 3. Download NBA games data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the nba-games from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: the name of data(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning before analysis using Python
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Load Data into Python using Pandas
   - **Set Up Environment**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and import necessary Python libraries like `pandas`.
   - **Load Data**: Read the cleaned dataset into a Pandas DataFrame from a local file (e.g., CSV, Excel).
   - **Verification**: Preview the data by displaying shape, column names, and the first few rows to confirm it loaded correctly.

### 8. Data Analysis: Business Problem Solving with Pandas
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Use Pandas and visualization libraries to answer key business questions, such as:
     - Which teams have the highest win rates at home?
     - Is FG% or 3PT% more correlated with winning?
     - How do rebounds affect game outcomes?
     - Are there any seasonal performance trends?
     - What factors most influence home team wins?
   - **Documentation**: Provide clear Markdown cells explaining each analysis step, including the question, method, and conclusion.

### 9. Documentation 
   - **Documentation**: Maintain clear and well-organized documentation using Markdown cells within Jupyter Notebooks and a comprehensive `README.md` file.
   - **Project Publishing**: Publish the final project on GitHub (or any version control platform), including:
     - The `README.md` file (this document).
     - All Jupyter Notebooks used throughout the project.
     - Any relevant data files (if shareable), or clear instructions on how to access them.
     - Python scripts (if any) for automation or reusable components.

## Results and Insights
This section will include your analysis findings:
- Team Performance: Identify teams with the highest win rates, especially at home, and analyze performance trends across the season.
- Scoring Efficiency: Explore how shooting percentages (FG%, 3PT%, FT%) correlate with game outcomes.
- Assist & Rebound Impact: Understand how playmaking (assists) and rebounding influence a team's chances of winning.
- Winning Factors: Key Metrics for Victory: Determine which features (e.g., field goal percentage, rebounds, assists) are the strongest predictors of a win.
- Home-Court Advantage: Analyze the statistical edge of playing at home vs. away.
- High-Scoring Games: Identify conditions or teams that are more likely to result in high-scoring matchups.
- Strategic Insights : Team Strength Profiles: Compare teams based on offensive and defensive metrics.
- Game Trends: Spot patterns over time — for example, improving or declining team performance across the season.
- Upset Detection: Highlight games where underperforming teams defeated stronger opponents and analyze why.
- Two models were developed to predict the probability of a home team win: Logistic Regression: Identifies how much each stat contributes to win likelihood and Random Forest: Captures complex interactions and ranks feature importance.

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions to this project:
- Interactive Dashboards:Integrate with visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly Dash to create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data dynamically.
- Incorporate Additional Data Sources: Add more datasets (e.g., from APIs, other databases, or external files) to deepen the analysis and provide more comprehensive insights.
- Automate Data Pipeline: Develop scripts or use tools (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) to automate data downloading, cleaning, and loading, enabling scheduled or real-time updates.
- Deploy as Web Application: Package the analysis and visualization into a web app (using Streamlit or Flask) to make it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- Enhance Data Cleaning and Validation: Improve preprocessing steps with more robust error handling and validation checks to ensure data quality.
